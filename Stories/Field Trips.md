Class 9: Used to attach a wireless mouse to the projector/computer. Played around with math teacher, deep, by moving the mouse around while he was writing. He used to think it needed calibration. "Monitor, calibrate!" every five minutes. Monitor, Kaustav played along too. Anubhav, Kirtan, Saswata, and Nandini knew and laughed along.
